# List
This program is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.

***
## What it does
This is my variant of list implementation with possibilities to sort and verify list structure. It is made not by pointers but by array indices.

***
## Why is the project useful
I strongly believe that writing your own version of data structure brings many benefits such as better understanding of its structure
(excuse me for tautology :)), ability to see its benefits or flaws, etc.

***
## How can I help
I explicitly welcome any outside contributors. Use my mail: _ilichev.kv@phystech.edu_.

__A strong request__:
- Do not break the codestyle
- Do not destroy previous functionality with additions

***
## Where to ask questions
Use the mail mentioned earlier.
