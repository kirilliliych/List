# List

***
## Briefly
List made not by pointers but by array indexes.

***
## What it does
This is my variant of list implementation with possibilities to sort and verify list structure.

***
## Why is the project useful
I strongly believe that writing your own version of data structure brings many benefits such as better understanding of its organization, ability to see its necessity or, vice versa, uselessness in certain case, etc.

***
## How can I help
I explicitly welcome any outside contributors. Use my mail: _ilichev.kv@phystech.edu_.

__A strong request__:
* Do not break the codestyle
* Do not destroy previous functionality with additions

***
## Where to ask questions
Use the mail mentioned earlier.
